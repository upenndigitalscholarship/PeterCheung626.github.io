## b.	The Preface Project– A Library Special Collections Project [link](http://pennds.org/prefaceproject/)
i.	The Preface Project is a multi-modal digital archive exploring the relationships among truth claims, direct address of the reader, and authorial voice in the prefaces of 1760s novels. The archive conceives of prefaces as products of and catalysts for relationality, while weaving together new layers of enmeshment, through curated cataloging and audio, visual, and textual digital reproductions.  Through the proliferation and linking of metadata, through the multimedia presentation of the prefaces, and through the open-access publication of the archived materials, the Preface Project generates new networks, entangling them with the conversations and relations of 1760s prefaces.

## c.	Archive for Ornamental Bodies– A Neatline Course Project  [link](http://pennds.org/archive-for-ornamental-bodies/exhibits/show/home)
i.	The Archive for Ornamental Bodies is an experiment in the documentation and description of bodies– natural bodies, human bodies, metaphysical bodies, linguistic bodies. The AOB collects bodies of all materials and forms. It is our particular mission, however, to gather bodies characterized by some extravagance or inessentiality, and to confer plentitude on their excess through the medium of language.   This exhibit was curated by the students of a Penn English Department Course.

## d.	The Wanamaker Bronze Collection– An Omeka Research Paper Supplement (hyperlink: [link](http://pennds.org/wanamaker/)
i.	Welcome to the website for the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology’s Wanamaker Bronze Collection. This collection is made up of 454 bronze reproductions of objects primarily from Pompeii and Herculaneum, ranging from small tools to life-size statues and furniture. John Wanamaker (1838–1922), the Philadelphia department store magnate and longtime member of the Museum’s Board of Managers, purchased these bronzes from J. Chiurazzi & Fils for the museum in 1904. Due to their status as reproductions, only a handful of these bronzes are on display. They are presented here in a more complete fashion. On this website, you will find information about the collection’s history; background on the Pompeiian house and the archaeological contexts of the originals; the Wanamaker Bronzes categorized by object type; featured groups of bronzes; bibliography; and contact information, including forms to request objects for class use or individual research.

## i.The Japanese Archaeological Collection at the University of Pennsylvania– An Omeka Course Project [link](http://pennds.org/japanese_archaeology/)
i.This class integrates the Japanese archaeological artifacts (188 items) and drawings (16 sheets) that were given to the Penn Museum at the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 as a gift from the Tokyo National Museum/Meiji Government. It is clear from the collection that the Tokyo National Museum, supported by the Meiji Government, carefully chose representative artifacts collected from all over Japan that would show the world a high level of sophistication in Japanese prehistoric materials. These items are composed primarily of intact pots representing the Japanese prehistoric periods, large ceramic sherds bearing elaborate surface decorations, elaborately manufactured stone tools, large drawings of major archaeological artifacts and sites in Japan, and rich ceremonial and ritual paraphernalia.

## k.	War and Conquest in Medieval Europe– An Omeka Course Project [link](http://pennds.org/medievalwarandconquest/)
i.	War was not only a series of actions, but it also permeated society in a very concrete way through physical objects and material texts. These objects and texts inscribed war in everyday settings and, beyond that, they also reaffirmed both the importance and glory of war. This exhibit examines the remains of the physical life of war. In other words, what were the aesthetics of medieval warfare? What made war appealing and/or beautiful? "The Aesthetics of Medieval Warfare" will treat aesthetics in a large way, not only in terms of beauty but in terms of physical expression more largely.

## l.	Here and Over There– An Omeka Course Project [link](http://pennds.org/nelc133/)
i.	This website was created as a project of a curatorial seminar at the University of Pennsylvania in the Fall of 2014. The aim of this project is to explore the historic engagement of the University of Pennsylvania and its faculty, students, and graduates in the Near and Middle East. It does so while drawing in part on objects and materials in the Penn Museum and across Penn’s campus. This site showcases just a sampling of the interesting objects – and stories – that help to tell the narrative of Penn’s engagement in the Middle East.

## m. Art at Penn– An Omeka Course Project [link](http://pennds.org/arth503640/)
i.	Through this website five students within the Fall 2015 course on Digital Art History (under the guidance of Professor Christopher Pastore) attempt to create an easy-to-use online art collection. Each student selected five artworks encompassing a spectrum of mediums, sizes, and locations throughout the University of Pennsylvania's existing art collection.

## n	Haudenosaunee Timeline– An Omeka Course Project [link](http://pennds.org/tbpdh/)
i.	Because the Creation Story of the Haudenosaunee has been passed on to generations by oral tradition, the story is different for every retelling. This version of the origin story is based on that of Chief Gibson.

## o.	Who Was Alfred Dreyfus?– A Library Special Collections Project [link]( http://pennds.org/whowasalfreddreyfus/)
i.	The materials on display here are facsimiles of originals in the Lorraine Beitler Collection of the Dreyfus Affair at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. This exhibition begins with a timeline and cast of characters and then gives a semi-chronological overview of the Dreyfus Affair, focusing on specific themes and individuals central to the Affair. It also examines the Affair from larger perspectives, exploring topics including the role of the military; images and graphics; social media and popular culture; women; the press and public opinion; and patriotism. Justice, truth, and loyalty: all were put to the test during the Dreyfus Affair, and its lessons will resonate with today’s audiences.

## p.Against the Current– A Scalar Course Project [link]( http://pennds.org/engl200blackfeminisms/radical-black-feminisms/index)
i.	This anthology was created by the members of Tajah Ebram’s Junior Research Seminar, "Radical Black Feminisms: Writing the Carceral State", at the University of Pennsylvania. The experience of this course was largely defined by the autobiographies of Angela Davis and Assata Shakur as well as anthologies like the New York Panther 21’s Look For Me in the Whirlwind (1971) and Revolutionary Mothering: Love On The Front Lines (2016). Within these writings, the intersecting issues of mass incarceration, poverty, education, sexual violence, and gender are laid bare. As a class, we studied these anthologies in depth to understand the power of the anthologizing form. Most importantly, these writers - majority identifying as radicalized black women, gave us blueprints for converting our lived experience and critical interpretations into an inclusive praxis, one that acknowledges the experiences and oppression of different intersecting identities. The works we studied in class were valuable frameworks as we took to producing our own critical and creative research works as actionable modes of reflection, response and extensions of these readings. Our class anthology collects the voices of our peers in the contemporary movement towards social progress in today's climate of mass incarceration, anti-black violence and violence against women and gender nonconforming people.

## q.	A Monument to Climate Change– A Scalar Course Project  [link](http://pennds.org/epic/a-monument-to-climate-change/index)
This project takes Lenape teachings, embodied by the statue of Teedyuscung, and considers how they are related to scientific understandings of the environment. Although Indigenous and scientific knowledge systems are quite different, the class discovered interesting intersections where the two systems speak eloquently to one another. The course project was created using Scalar

## r. Centennial Exhibition– A Neatline Library Project [link](http://pennds.org/centennial/)
i.	This project grew out of an inventory of the Centennial collection in the Perkins Rare Book Room [link](http://guides.library.upenn.edu/fisherrarebooks) at the Fisher Fine Arts library, and What We Saw and How We Saw It, the book selected for the basis of this project. The text is a tour guide written for visitors to Memorial Hall, the art gallery of the Centennial. The way the text is written, visitors are guided from gallery to gallery, and are told about the different paintings and artists on exhibit. By recreating the gallery space virtually, we can move through Memorial Hall as visitors in 1876 would have done, experiencing the space and the paintings in the same context. Due to time constraints, only the American section has been covered. But, it is hoped that this project will be continued, so that the full gallery tour will be available.
